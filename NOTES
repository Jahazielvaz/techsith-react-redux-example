Things I've learned

es6 feature. When you add an equal sign inside the parameter, you're telling your function to make whatever is on the other side of the equal sign, the default state
  EXAMPLE:
    const initialState = {
      age: 21
    }

    const myFunc = (state = initialState, action) => {

    }

    In the example above, myFunc is going to to use the object called initialState as it's default state if no other state is given to it.
